a predefined structure or schema.

3. Semi-Structured Data

Definition: Data that is not as organized 
as structured data but has some level of 
structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, 
or other patterns.

Characteristics:

some way
- More flexible than structured data but not 
as chaotic as unstructured data
