# AWS DEA-C01 certification
# Types of data:
## 1. Structured

Data that is organized in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relational databases.

Characteristics: 
- Easily queryable
- Organized in rows and columns
- Has a consistent structure
  
Examples:
- Database tables
- CSV files with consistent columns
- Excel spreadsheet
  
## 2. Unstructured

Data that doesn't have a predefined structure or schema.

Characteristics:
- Not easily queryable without preprocessing
- May come in various formats

Examples: 
- Text files without a fixed format
- Videos and audio files
- Images
- Emails and word processing documents

## 3. Semi-Structured Data

Data that is not as organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.

Characteristics: 
- Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way
- More flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data

Examples: 
- XML and JSON files
- Email headers (which have a mix of structured fields like date, subject, etc., and unstructured data in the body)
- Log files with varied format

# Properties of Data (3V)
1. Volume

Refers to the amount or size of data that organizations are dealing with at any given time

Characteristics:
- May range from gigabytes to petabytes or even more
- Challenges in storing, processing, and analyzing high volumes of data

Examples:
- Social media platform processing terabytes of data daily from user posts, 
images, and videos.
- Retailers collecting years' worth of transaction data, amounting to several petabytes

2. Velocity

Refers to the speed at which new data is generated, collected, and processed

Characteristics:
- High velocity requires real-time or near-real-time processing capabilities
- Rapid (fast) ingestion and processing can be critical for certain applications

Examples:
- Sensor data from IoT devices streaming readings every millisecond (Streaming data aplications)
- High-frequency trading systems where milliseconds can make a difference in decision-making

3. Variety

Refers to the different types, structures, and sources of data

Characteristics:
- Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
- Data can come from multiple sources and in various formats

Examples:
- A business analyzing data from relational databases (structured), emails (unstructured), and JSON logs (semi-structured).
- Healthcare systems collecting data from electronic medical records, wearable health devices, and patient feedback forms.
