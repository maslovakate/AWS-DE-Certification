# AWS DEA-C01 certification
# Types of data:
## 1. Structured

Data that is organized in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relational databases.

Characteristics: 
- Easily queryable;
- Organized in rows and columns;
- Has a consistent structure.
  
Examples:
- Database tables;
- CSV files with consistent columns;
- Excel spreadsheet.
  
## 2. Unstructured

Data that doesn't have a predefined structure or schema.

Characteristics:
- Not easily queryable without preprocessing;
- May come in various formats.

Examples: 
- Text files without a fixed format;
- Videos and audio files;
- Images;
- Emails and word processing documents.

## 3. Semi-Structured Data

Data that is not as organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.

Characteristics: 
- Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way;
- More flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data.

Examples: 
- XML and JSON files;
- Email headers (which have a mix of structured fields like date, subject, etc., and unstructured data in the body);
- Log files with varied format.

# Properties of Data (3V)
## 1. Volume

Refers to the amount or size of data that organizations are dealing with at any given time.

Characteristics:
- May range from gigabytes to petabytes or even more;
- Challenges in storing, processing, and analyzing high volumes of data.

Examples:
- Social media platform processing terabytes of data daily from user posts, 
images, and videos;
- Retailers collecting years' worth of transaction data, amounting to several petabytes.

## 2. Velocity

Refers to the speed at which new data is generated, collected, and processed.

Characteristics:
- High velocity requires real-time or near-real-time processing capabilities;
- Rapid (fast) ingestion and processing can be critical for certain applications.

Examples:
- Sensor data from IoT devices streaming readings every millisecond (Streaming data aplications);
- High-frequency trading systems where milliseconds can make a difference in decision-making.

## 3. Variety

Refers to the different types, structures, and sources of data.

Characteristics:
- Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured;
- Data can come from multiple sources and in various formats.

Examples:
- A business analyzing data from relational databases (structured), emails (unstructured), and JSON logs (semi-structured);
- Healthcare systems collecting data from electronic medical records, wearable health devices, and patient feedback forms.

# Data Warehouse vs Data Lake

## Data Warehouse 

A centralized repository optimized for analysis where data from different sources is stored in a structured format.

Characteristics:
- Designed for complex queries and analysis;
- Data is cleaned, transformed, and loaded (ETL process);
- Typically uses a star or snowflake schema;
- Optimized for read-heavy operations.

Examples:
- Amazon Redshift;
- Google BigQuery;
- Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehous.

## Data Lake

A storage repository that holds vast amounts of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Characteristics:
- Can store large volumes of raw data without predefined schema;
- Data is loaded as-is, no need for preprocessing;
- Supports batch, real-time, and stream processing;
- Can be queried for data transformation or exploration purposes.

Examples:
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) when used as a data lake;
- Azure Data Lake Storage;
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

## Comparing the two 

**Schema:**
- Data Warehouse:Schema-on-write (predefined schema before writing data):
  - Extract – Transform – Load (ETL);
- Data Lake: Schema-on-read (schema is defined at the time of reading data):
  - Extract – Load – Transform (ELT).

**Data Types:**
- Data Warehouse: Primarily structured data;
- Data Lake: Both structured and unstructured data;

**Agility:**
- Data Warehouse: Less agile due to predefined schema;
- Data Lake: More agile as it accepts raw data without a predefined structure.

**Processing:** 
- Data Warehouse: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load);
- Data Lake: ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) or just Load for storage purposes.

**Cost:**
- Data Warehouse: Typically more expensive because of optimizations for complex queries;
- Data Lake: Cost-effective storage solutions, but costs can rise when processing large amounts of data.

## Choosing a Warehouse vs. a Lake

Use a Data Warehouse when: 
- You have structured data sources and require fast and complex queries;
- Data integration from different sources is essential;
-  Business intelligence and analytics are the primary use cases.

Use a Data Lake when: 
- You have a mix of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data;
- You need a scalable and cost-effective solution to store massive amounts of data;
- Future needs for data are uncertain, and you want flexibility in storage and processing;
- Advanced analytics, machine learning, or data discovery are key goals.

Often, organizations use a combination of both, ingesting raw data into a data lake and then processing and moving refined data into a data warehouse for analysis.

## Data Lakehouse

A hybrid data architecture that combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses, aiming to provide the performance, reliability, and capabilities of a data warehouse while maintaining the flexibility, scale, and low-cost storage of data lakes.

Characteristics: 
- Supports both structured and unstructured data;
- Allows for schema-on-write and schema-on-read;
- Provides capabilities for both detailed analytics and machine learning tasks;
- Typically built on top of cloud or distributed architectures;
- Benefits from technologies like Delta Lake, which bring ACID transactions to big data.

Examples: 
- AWS Lake Formation (with S3 and Redshift Spectrum);
- Delta Lake: An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads;
- Databricks Lakehouse Platform: A unified platform that combines the capabilities of data lakes and data warehouses;
- Azure Synapse Analytics: Microsoft's analytics service that brings together big data and data warehousing.

# Data Mesh

A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by a specific business domain—for example, marketing, sales, customer service and more—to provide more ownership to the producers of a given data set.

it’s more about governance and organization.

Data lakes, warehouses, etc. may be part of a data mesh, but a “data mesh” is more about the “data management paradigm” and not the specific technologies or architectures.

# ETL Pipelines

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It's a process used to move data from source systems into a data warehouse.

Extract:
- Retrieve raw data from source systems, which can be databases, CRMs, flat files, APIs, or other data repositories;
- Ensure data integrity during the extraction phase;
- Can be done in real-time or in batches, depending on requirements.

Transform:
- Convert the extracted data into a format suitable for the target data warehouse;
- Can involve various operations such as:
  - Data cleansing (e.g., removing duplicates, fixing errors);
  - Data enrichment (e.g., adding additional data from other sources);
  - Format changes (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation);
  - Aggregations or computations (e.g., calculating totals or averages);
  - Encoding or decoding data;
  - Handling missing values.

Load:
- Move the transformed data into the target data warehouse or another data repository;
- Can be done in batches (all at once) or in a streaming manner (as data becomes available);
- Ensure that data maintains its integrity during the loading phase.

## Managing ETL Pipelines 
ETL Pipelines must be automated in some reliable way.
- AWS Glue;
- Orchestration services:
  - EventBridge;
  - Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow [Amazon MWAA];
  - AWS Step Functions;

# Data Modeling
**1. Relational Model**

Usually found in OLTP systems.

**2. Dimensional Model**

## 1. Star Schema
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca61b0d-3603-402e-a417-1bbd6e555849)

  
  This schema consists of a central table, called the fact table, and a number of directly connected other tables, called dimension tables. The fact table contains information about metrics or measures, while the dimension tables contain information about descriptive attributes.
  
## 2. Snowflake Schema
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db4ed9e1-3e66-426d-bf18-22fd1666f0e7)
  This schema consists of a central fact table, connected to the fact table dimension tables and additional dimension tables connected to the dimension tables.

## 6 key differences between star schema and snowflake schema:
1. A star schema has denormalized dimension tables, while a snowflake schema has normalized dimension tables;
2. A star schema is easier to design and implement than a snowflake schema;
3. A star schema can be more efficient to query than a snowflake schema, because there are fewer JOINs between tables;
4. A star schema can require more storage space than a snowflake schema, because of the denormalized data;
5. A star schema can be more difficult to update than a snowflake schema, because of the denormalized data;
6. A star schema can be more difficult to troubleshoot than a snowflake schema, because of the denormalized data.

# Data Lineage
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe19641-825d-4b17-bdd6-b6f2c9d686d2)

A visual representation that traces the flow and transformation of data through its lifecycle, from its source to its final destination.

**Importance:** 
- Helps in tracking errors back to their source;
- Ensures compliance with regulations;
- Provides a clear understanding of how data is moved, transformed, and consumed within systems.

# Schema Evolution 

The ability to adapt and change the schema of a dataset over time without disrupting existing processes or systems.

Importance: 
- Ensures data systems can adapt to changing business requirements;
- Allows for the addition, removal, or modification of columns/fields in a dataset;
- Maintains backward compatibility with older data records.

Tool: Glue Schema Registry
- Schema discovery, compatibility, validation, registration.

# Database Performance Optimization
## 1. Indexing
- Avoid full table scans!
- Enforce data uniqueness and integrity.

## 2. Partitioning
- Reduce amount of data scanned;
- Helps with data lifecycle management;
- Enables parallel processing.

## 3. Compression
- Speed up data transfer, reduce storage & disk reads;
- GZIP, LZOP, BZIP2, ZSTD (Redshift examples);
- Various tradeoffs between compression & speed;
- Columnar compression.

# Data Sampling Techniques

When you need to take data from a big dataset for exploratory data analysis or any other analytical purpose.

## 1. Random Sampling
- Everything has an equal chance

## 2. Stratified Sampling
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4cc418c-25ec-46ec-83bd-9fd511489cb2)

- Divide population into homogenous subgroups (strata);
- Random sample within each stratum;
- Ensures representation of each subgroup.

## 3. Others

Systemic: give me every third item for the data sample

- Systemic, Cluster, Convenience, Judgmental

# Data Skew Mechanisms 

Data skew refers to the unequal distribution or imbalance of data across various nodes or partitions in distributed computing systems.

**Causes:** 
- Non-uniform distribution of data;
- Inadequate partitioning strategy;
- Temporal skew;
- Important to monitor data distribution and alert when skew issues arise.

## Addressing Data Skew

**1. Adaptive Partitioning:**
Dynamically adjust partitioning based on data characteristics to ensure a more balanced distribution.

**2. Salting:**
Introduce a random factor or "salt" to the data to distribute it more uniformly.

**3. Repartitioning:**
Regularly redistribute the data based on its current distribution characteristics.

**4. Sampling:**
Use a sample of the data to determine the distribution and adjust the processing strategy accordingly.

**5. Custom Partitioning:**
Define custom rules or functions for partitioning data based on domain knowledge

# Data Validation and Profiling
## 1. Completeness
Ensures all required data is present and no essential parts are missing.

Checks: 
- Missing values, null counts, percentage of populated fields.

Importance: 
- Missing data can lead to inaccurate analyses and insights.

## 2. Consistency
Ensures data values are consistent across datasets and do not contradict each other.

Checks: 
- Cross-field validation, comparing data from different sources or periods.

Importance: 
- Inconsistent data can cause confusion and result in incorrect conclusions.

## 3. Accuracy
Ensures data is correct, reliable, and represents what it is supposed to.

Checks: 
- Comparing with trusted sources, validation against known standards or rules.

Importance: 
- Inaccurate data can lead to false insights and poor decision-making.

## 4. Integrity
Ensures data maintains its correctness and consistency over its lifecycle and across systems.

Checks: 
- Referential integrity (e.g., foreign key checks in databases), relationship validations.

Importance: 
- Ensures relationships between data elements are preserved, and data remains trustworthy over time.

# Storage
Storing, accessing, and backing up data in AWS

# Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is ”infinitely scaling” storage
## Amazon S3 Use cases:
- Backup and storage;
- Disaster Recovery;
- Archive;
- Hybrid Cloud storage;
- Application hosting;
- Media hosting;
- Data lakes & big data analytics;
- Software delivery;
- Static website.

## Amazon S3 – Objects (cont.)
- Object values are the content of the body:
  - Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB);
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”;
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata);
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle; 
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled).

## Amazon S3 – Security
- User-Based:
  - IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM;
- Resource-Based:
  - Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account;
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled);
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled);
- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if:
  - The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it;
  - AND there’s no explicit DENY;
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption key.

## S3 Bucket Policies 
- JSON based policies:
  - Resources: buckets and objects;
  - Effect: Allow / Deny;
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny;
  - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to;
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket;
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload;
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account).

## Amazon S3 - Versioning
- You can version your files in Amazon S3;
- It is enabled at the **bucket level**;
- Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3…;
- It is best practice to version your buckets;
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version);
  - Easy roll back to previous version;
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”;
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions.

## Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR)
- **Must enable Versioning** in source and destination buckets;
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**;
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**;
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts;
- Copying is asynchronous;
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3;
- Use cases:
  - **CRR** - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts;
  - **SRR** - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts.

## Amazon S3 – Replication (Notes)
- After you enable Replication, only new objects are replicated;
- Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using S3 Batch Replication;
  - Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication;
- For DELETE operations:
  - Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting);
  - Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes);
- There is no “chaining” of replication:
  - If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3;
  - Then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3.

## S3 Storage Classes
- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose;
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA);
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access;
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval;
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval;
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive;
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering.

- Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

## S3 Durability and Availability
- Durability:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ;
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years;
  - Same for all storage classes;
- Availability:
  - Measures how readily available a service is;
  - Varies depending on storage class;
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year.

## S3 Standard – General Purpose
- 99.99% Availability;
- Used for frequently accessed data;
- Low latency and high throughput;
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures.

- Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution…

## S3 Storage Classes – Infrequent Access
- For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed;
- Lower cost than S3 Standard.

- **Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access** (S3 Standard-IA)
  - 99.9% Availability;
  - Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups.

- **Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access** (S3 One Zone-IA)
  - High durability (99.999999999%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed;
  - 99.5% Availability;
  - Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data, or data you can recreate.

## Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup;
- Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost.

- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval:
  - Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter;
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days;
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier):
  - Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) – free;
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days;
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive – for long term storage:
  - Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours);
  - Minimum storage duration of 180 days

## S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee;
- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage;
- There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering;

- Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier;
- Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days;
- Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days;
- Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days;
- Deep Archive Access tier (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days.

## Amazon S3 – Lifecycle Rules
- Transition Actions – configure objects to transition to another storage class;
  - Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation;
  - Move to Glacier for archiving after 6 months;
- Expiration actions – configure objects to expire (delete) after some time;
  - Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days;
  - Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled);
  - Can be used to delete incomplete Multi-Part uploads;
- Rules can be created for a certain prefix (example: s3://mybucket/mp3/*);
- Rules can be created for certain objects Tags (example: Department: Finance).

## Amazon S3 – Lifecycle Rules (Scenario 1)
Your application on EC2 creates images thumbnails after profile photos are uploaded to Amazon S3. These thumbnails can be easily recreated, and only need to be kept for 60 days. The source images should be able to be immediately retrieved for these 60 days, and afterwards, the user can wait up to 6 hours. How would you design this?
- S3 source images can be on Standard, with a lifecycle configuration to transition them to Glacier after 60 days;
- S3 thumbnails can be on One-Zone IA, with a lifecycle configuration to expire them (delete them) after 60 days.

## Amazon S3 – Lifecycle Rules (Scenario 2)
A rule in your company states that you should be able to recover your deleted S3 objects immediately for 30 days, although this may happen rarely. After this time, and for up to 365 days, deleted objects should be recoverable within 48 hours.
- Enable S3 Versioning in order to have object versions, so that “deleted objects” are in fact hidden by a “delete marker” and can be recovered;
- Transition the “noncurrent versions” of the object to Standard IA;
- Transition afterwards the “noncurrent versions” to Glacier Deep Archive.

## S3 Event Notifications
S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication…

## S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e1e838-e487-44fd-9682-8c92d3880164)
- Advanced filtering options with JSON rules (metadata, object size, name...);
- Multiple Destinations – ex Step Functions, Kinesis Streams / Firehose…;
- EventBridge Capabilities – Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery.

## S3 – Baseline Performance
- Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200 ms;
- Your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket; 
- There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket;
- Example (object path => prefix):
  - bucket/folder1/sub1/file => /folder1/sub1/;
  - bucket/folder1/sub2/file => /folder1/sub2/;
  - bucket/1/file => /1/;
  - bucket/2/file => /2/;
- If you spread reads across all four prefixes evenly, you can achieve 22,000 requests per second for GET and HEAD.

## S3 Performance
- Multi-Part upload: 
  - recommended for files > 100MB, must use for files > 5GB;
  - Can help parallelize uploads (speed up transfers);
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**:
  - Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region;
  - Compatible with multi-part upload.

## S3 Performance – S3 Byte-Range Fetches
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617cfccd-dcca-4305-81bf-2afc7647606b)

## S3 Select & Glacier Select
- Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server-side filtering;
- Can filter by rows & columns (simple SQL statements);
- Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e1398f-37c4-4b1f-9d03-5d764483fd19)

## Amazon S3 – Object Encryption
You can encrypt objects in S3 buckets using one of 4 methods
- Server-Side Encryption (SSE);
  - Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys **(SSE-S3)** – Enabled by Default. Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS;
  - Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS **(SSE-KMS)**. Leverage AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys;
  - Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys **(SSE-C)** ;
- Client-Side Encryption. When you want to manage your own encryption keys.

## Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-S3
- Encryption using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS;
- Object is encrypted server-side;
- Encryption type is AES-256;
- Must set header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**;
- **Enabled by default for new buckets & new objects**.

## Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-KMS
- Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service);
- KMS advantages: user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail;
- Object is encrypted server side;
- Must set header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"**.

## SSE-KMS Limitation
- If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits;
- When you upload, it calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API;
- When you download, it calls the Decrypt KMS API;
- Count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region);
- You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console.

## Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-C
- Server-Side Encryption using keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS;
- Amazon S3 does NOT store the encryption key you provide;
- HTTPS must be used;
- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made.

## Amazon S3 Encryption – Client-Side Encryption
- Use client libraries such as Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library;
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to Amazon S3;
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from Amazon S3;
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle.

## S3 – Access Points
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ffb7206-7b12-4fe8-bf61-9906a78b2469)

## S3 Object Lambda
- Use AWS Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application;
- Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 Access Point and S3 Object Lambda Access Points.
- Use Cases:
  - Redacting personally identifiable information for analytics or nonproduction environments;
  - Converting across data formats, such as converting XML to JSON;
- Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using callerspecific details, such as the user who requested the object;

# EC2 Instance Storage Section
## What’s an EBS Volume?
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination;
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level);
- They are bound to a specific availability zone;
- Analogy: Think of them as a “network USB stick”; 
- Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month.

## EBS Volume
- It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive);
- It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency;
- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly;
- It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ);
  - An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b;
  - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it;
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS);
- You get billed for all the provisioned capacity;
- You can increase the capacity of the drive over time.

## Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes
- You don’t have to detach a volume or restart your instance to change it! (Just go to actions / modify volume from the console);
- Increase volume size. (You can only increase, not decrease);
- Change volume type. (Gp2 -> Gp3);
- Specify desired IOPS or throughput performance (or it will guess);
- Adjust performance. (Increase or decrease).

## Amazon EFS – Elastic File System
- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2;
- EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ;
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a324f78-de91-48a4-a4ac-cdbf182b352b)

## Amazon EFS – Elastic File System
Use cases: 
- content management;
- web serving;
- data sharing;
- wordpress.

  - Uses NFSv4.1 protocol;
  - Uses security group to control access to EFS;
  - **Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)**;
  - Encryption at rest using KMS;
  - POSIX file system (~Linux) that has a standard file API;
  - File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning.

## EFS – Performance & Storage Classes
- EFS Scale:
  - 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput;
  - Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically;
- Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time):
  - General Purpose (default) – latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc…);
  - Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing);
- Throughput Mode:
  - Bursting – 1 TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s;
  - Provisioned – set your throughput regardless of storage size, ex: 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage;
  - Elastic – automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads:
    - Up to 3GiB/s for reads and 1GiB/s for writes;
    - Used for unpredictable workloads.

## EFS – Storage Classes
- Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature – move file after N days);
- Standard: for frequently accessed files;
- Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store;
- Archive: rarely accessed data (few times each year), 50% cheaper;
- Implement lifecycle policies to move files between storage tiers;
- Availability and durability;
- Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod;
- One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA);
- Over 90% in cost savings.

## EBS vs EFS – Elastic Block Storage
- EBS volumes:
  - one instance (except multi-attach io1/io2);
  - are locked at the Availability Zone (AZ) level;
  - gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases;
  - gp3 & io1: can increase IO independently.
- To migrate an EBS volume across AZ:
  - Take a snapshot; 
  - Restore the snapshot to another AZ;
  - EBS backups use IO and you shouldn’t run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic.
- Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated. (you can disable that).

## EBS vs EFS – Elastic File System
- Mounting 100s of instances across AZ;
- EFS share website files (WordPress);
- Only for Linux Instances (POSIX);
- EFS has a higher price point than EBS;
- Can leverage Storage Tiers for cost savings.
    - Remember: **EFS vs EBS vs Instance Store**.

## AWS Backup Vault Lock
- Enforce a WORM (Write Once Read Many) state for all the backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault.
- Additional layer of defense to protect your backups against:
  - Inadvertent or malicious delete operations;
  - Updates that shorten or alter retention periods;
  - Even the root user cannot delete backups when enabled.

# Database
Managing and querying structured and semi-structured data.

## Amazon DynamoDB
NoSQL Serverless Database.

## Traditional Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/107366d5-ccdd-47ef-9387-ac22a72a46d4)
- Traditional applications leverage RDBMS databases;
- These databases have the SQL query language;
- Strong requirements about how the data should be modeled;
- Ability to do query joins, aggregations, complex computations;
- Vertical scaling (getting a more powerful CPU / RAM / IO);
- Horizontal scaling (increasing reading capability by adding EC2 / RDS Read Replicas.

## NoSQL databases
- NoSQL databases are non-relational databases and are distributed;
- NoSQL databases include MongoDB, DynamoDB, …;
- NoSQL databases do not support query joins (or just limited support);
- All the data that is needed for a query is present in one row;
- NoSQL databases don’t perform aggregations such as “SUM”, “AVG”, …;
- NoSQL databases scale horizontally;
  - There’s no “right or wrong” for NoSQL vs SQL, they just require to model the data differently and think about user queries differently.

## Amazon DynamoDB 
- Fully managed, highly available with replication across multiple AZs;
- NoSQL database - not a relational database;
- Scales to massive workloads, distributed database;
- Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage;
- Fast and consistent in performance (low latency on retrieval);
- Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration;
- Enables event driven programming with DynamoDB Streams;
- Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities;
- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Clas.

## DynamoDB - Basics
- DynamoDB is made of Tables;
- Each table has a Primary Key (must be decided at creation time);
- Each table can have an infinite number of items (= rows);
- Each item has attributes (can be added over time – can be null);
- Maximum size of an item is 400KB.
- Data types supported are:
  - Scalar Types: String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null;
  - Document Types: List, Map;
  - Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set.
 
## DynamoDB – Primary Keys 
- **Option 1**: Partition Key **(HASH)**
  - Partition key must be unique for each item;
  - Partition key must be “diverse” so that the data is distributed;
Example: “User_ID” for a users table
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0f061b5-2dce-41af-8d5a-c84c77123e9a)
- **Option 2**: Partition Key + Sort Key **(HASH + RANGE)**
  - The combination must be unique for each item;
  - Data is grouped by partition key.
Example: users-games table, “User_ID” for Partition Key and “Game_ID” for Sort Key.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81f62e11-eef5-4648-a65b-0699c8db5d75)

## DynamoDB in Big Data
**Common use cases include**: 
- Mobile apps; 
- Gaming;
- Digital ad serving;
- Live voting;
- Audience interaction for live events;
- Sensor networks;
- Log ingestion;
- Access control for web-based content;
- Metadata storage for Amazon S3 objects;
- E-commerce shopping carts;
- Web session management.

**Anti Pattern**:
- Prewritten application tied to a traditional relational database: use RDS instead;
- Joins or complex transactions ;
- Binary Large Object (BLOB) data: store data in S3 & metadata in DynamoDB;
- Large data with low I/O rate: use S3 instead.

## DynamoDB – Read/Write Capacity Modes
Control how you manage your table’s capacity (read/write throughput)
1. Provisioned Mode (default)
- You specify the number of reads/writes per second;
- You need to plan capacity beforehand;
- Pay for provisioned read & write capacity units.
2. On-Demand Mode
- Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads;
- No capacity planning needed;
- Pay for what you use, more expensive ($$$).

You can switch between different modes once every 24 hours.

## R/W Capacity Modes – Provisioned
- Table must have provisioned read and write capacity units;
- Read Capacity Units **(RCU)** – throughput for reads;
- Write Capacity Units **(WCU)** – throughput for writes;
- Option to setup auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand;
- Throughput can be exceeded temporarily using “Burst Capacity”;
- If Burst Capacity has been consumed, you’ll get a “ProvisionedThroughputExceededException”;
- It’s then advised to do an exponential backoff retry.

## DynamoDB – Write Capacity Units (WCU)
- One Write Capacity Unit (WCU) represents **one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size**
- If the items are larger than 1 KB, more WCUs are consumed

- **Example 1**: we write 10 items per second, with item size 2 KB;

        10 ∗ (2 𝐾𝐵 / 1 𝐾𝐵) = 20 𝑊𝐶𝑈𝑠
- **Example 2**: we write 6 items per second, with item size 4.5 KB;

        6 ∗ (5 𝐾𝐵 / 1 𝐾𝐵) = 30 𝑊𝐶𝑈𝑠 (4.5 gets rounded to the upper KB)
- **Example 3**: we write 120 items per minute, with item size 2 KB.

        120 / 60 ∗ (2 𝐾𝐵 / 1 𝐾𝐵) = 4 𝑊𝐶𝑈𝑠

## Strongly Consistent Read vs. Eventually Consistent Read
1. Eventually Consistent Read (default)
- If we read just after a write, it’s possible we’ll get some stale data because of replication
2. Strongly Consistent Read
- If we read just after a write, we will get the correct data;
- Set “ConsistentRead” parameter to True in API calls (GetItem, BatchGetItem, Query, Scan);
- Consumes twice the RCU.

## DynamoDB – Read Capacity Units (RCU)
One Read Capacity Unit (RCU) represents one Strongly Consistent Read per second, or two Eventually Consistent Reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size.
If the items are larger than 4 KB, more RCUs are consumed.
- **Example 1**: 10 Strongly Consistent Reads per second, with item size 4 KB;

        10 ∗ (4 𝐾𝐵 / 4 𝐾𝐵) = 10 𝑅𝐶𝑈𝑠
- **Example 2**: 16 Eventually Consistent Reads per second, with item size 12 KB;

        16 / 2 ∗ (12 𝐾𝐵 / 4 𝐾𝐵) = 24 𝑅𝐶𝑈𝑠
- **Example 3**: 10 Strongly Consistent Reads per second, with item size 6 KB.

        10 ∗ (8 𝐾𝐵 / 4 𝐾𝐵) = 20 𝑅𝐶𝑈𝑠 (we must round up 6 KB to 8 KB)

## DynamoDB – Partitions Internal
- Data is stored in partitions;
- Partition Keys go through a hashing algorithm to know to which partition they go to.

To compute the number of partitions:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/018ae4ac-abf3-41f9-9b88-c238dd7e8d4e)

**WCUs and RCUs are spread evenly across partitions**.

## DynamoDB – Throttling
**If we exceed provisioned RCUs or WCUs, we get “ProvisionedThroughputExceededException”**
- **Reasons**:
  - Hot Keys – one partition key is being read too many times (e.g., popular item);
  - Hot Partitions;
  - Very large items, remember RCU and WCU depends on size of items.
- **Solutions**:
  - Exponential backoff when exception is encountered (already in SDK);
  - Distribute partition keys as much as possible;
  - If RCU issue, we can use **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**.

## R/W Capacity Modes – On-Demand
- Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads;
- No capacity planning needed (WCU / RCU);
- Unlimited WCU & RCU, no throttle, more expensive;
- You’re charged for reads/writes that you use in terms of RRU and WRU;
- Read Request Units (RRU) – throughput for reads (same as RCU);
- Write Request Units (WRU) – throughput for writes (same as WCU);
- 2.5x more expensive than provisioned capacity (use with care).

**Use cases: unknown workloads, unpredictable application traffic**

## DynamoDB – Writing Data
**1. PutItem**
  - Creates a new item or fully replace an old item (same Primary Key);
  - Consumes WCUs.
**2. UpdateItem**
  - Edits an existing item’s attributes or adds a new item if it doesn’t exist;
  - Can be used to implement Atomic Counters – a numeric attribute that’s unconditionally incremented.
**3. Conditional Writes**
  - Accept a write/update/delete only if conditions are met, otherwise returns an error;
  - Helps with concurrent access to items;
  - No performance impact.

## DynamoDB – Reading Data
**GetItem**
  - Read based on Primary key;
  - Primary Key can be **HASH** or **HASH + RANGE**;
  - Eventually Consistent Read (default);
  - Option to use Strongly Consistent Reads (more RCU - might take longer);
  - **ProjectionExpression** can be specified to retrieve only certain attributes.

## DynamoDB – Reading Data (Query)
- **Query** returns items based on:
  - **KeyConditionExpression**;
    - **Partition Key value** (must be = operator) – required;
    - **Sort Key value** (=, <, <=, >, >=, Between, Begins with) – optional.
  - **FilterExpression**
    - Additional filtering after the Query operation (before data returned to you);
    - Use only with non-key attributes (does not allow HASH or RANGE attributes).
- Returns:
  - The number of items specified in Limit;
  - Or up to 1 MB of data.
- Ability to do pagination on the results
- Can query table, a Local Secondary Index, or a Global Secondary Index.

## DynamoDB – Reading Data (Scan)
- Scan the entire table and then filter out data (inefficient);
- Returns up to 1 MB of data – use pagination to keep on reading;
- Consumes a lot of RCU;
- Limit impact using Limit or reduce the size of the result and pause;
- For faster performance, use **Parallel Scan**:
  - Multiple workers scan multiple data segments at the same time;
  - Increases the throughput and RCU consumed;
  - Limit the impact of parallel scans just like you would for Scans.
- Can use ProjectionExpression & FilterExpression (no changes to RCU).

## DynamoDB – Deleting Data
**1. DeleteItem**
  - Delete an individual item;
  - Ability to perform a conditional delete.
**2. DeleteTable**
  - Delete a whole table and all its items;
  - Much quicker deletion than calling DeleteItem on all items.

## DynamoDB – Batch Operations
- Allows you to save in latency by reducing the number of API calls;
- Operations are done in parallel for better efficiency;
- Part of a batch can fail; in which case we need to try again for the failed items.

**1. BatchWriteItem**
  - Up to 25 PutItem and/or DeleteItem in one call
  - Up to 16 MB of data written, up to 400 KB of data per item
  - Can’t update items (use UpdateItem)
  - **UnprocessedItems** for failed write operations (exponential backoff or add WCU)

**2. BatchGetItem**
  - Return items from one or more tables;
  - Up to 100 items, up to 16 MB of data;
  - Items are retrieved in parallel to minimize latency;
  - UnprocessedKeys for failed read operations (exponential backoff or add RCU).

## DynamoDB – PartiQL
SQL-compatible query language for DynamoDB
- Allows you to select, insert, update, and delete data in DynamoDB using SQL;
- Run queries across multiple DynamoDB tables;
- Run PartiQL queries from:
  - AWS Management Console;
  - NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB;
  - DynamoDB APIs;
  - AWS CLI;
  - AWS SDK.
  
        Select OrderId, Total
        From Orders
        Where OrderId in [1, 2, 3]
        Order by OrderId;

## DynamoDB – Local Secondary Index (LSI)
- **Alternative Sort Key** for your table (same Partition Key as that of base table)
- The Sort Key consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
- Up to 5 Local Secondary Indexes per table
- **Must be defined at table creation time**
- **Attribute Projections** – can contain some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
